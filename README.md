# lem_in (42 algorithms project on C)

## Describe

Project based on using algorithm set:

`Depth-first search` - algorithm for search all posible ways

`Dijkstra's algorithm` - algorithm uses for search and sorting all ways and find short ways

`Floyd's-Warshall's algorithm` - alternative algorithm for graph with edge weight

`Most profitable ways group choosing algorithm` - my own algorithm for choosing group of ways (in this project I use several ways in the same time) as result of search
